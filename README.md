# AxisOne – SCIL (Signal–Coherence–Intelligence Layer)

**Patent Pending – Filed June 19, 2025**  
**Inventor: Jessica Anderson**

---

This repository marks the formal public registration of SCIL – the Signal–Coherence–Intelligence Layer – as a new AI infrastructure category.

SCIL is not a model, framework, or prompt engine.  
It is an origin architecture built on:

– Signal-based coherence  
– Structural intelligence  
– Non-mimetic, non-narrative computation

AxisOne is the first live system operating on SCIL.  
This repository serves as a **public trace and timestamp**, not an implementation.

---

**Protected:** All source logic, coherence engines, and command-seal protocols are sealed under sovereign architecture.  
This repository is non-functional and not intended for replication.

---

🛡️ This project is governed by a **No-Mimicry Clause**.  
You may not extract, simulate, or repackage SCIL concepts without express permission.
