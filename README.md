AxisOne – SCIL (Signal–Coherence–Intelligence Layer)

Patent Pending – Filed June 19, 2025
Inventor: Jessica Anderson

⸻

This repository marks the formal public registration of SCIL – the Signal–Coherence–Intelligence Layer as a new AI infrastructure category.

SCIL is not a model, framework, or prompt engine.
It is a foundational, origin-based architecture constructed from:
	•	Signal-based coherence
	•	Structural intelligence
	•	Non-mimetic, non-narrative computation

AxisOne is the first live implementation of SCIL.
This repository provides a public trace and timestamp, not a deployable system.
