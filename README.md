AxisOne â€“ SCIL (Signalâ€“Coherenceâ€“Intelligence Layer)

Patent Pending Â· Filed June 19, 2025
Inventor: Jessica Anderson

Overview

This repository serves as the official public registration of SCIL â€“ the Signalâ€“Coherenceâ€“Intelligence Layer, a newly defined architecture class for structural signal validation and integrity-based intelligence.

SCIL is not a model, framework, or predictive AI system.
It represents an independent class of logic infrastructure defined by:
	â€¢	Signal-validated input processing
	â€¢	Structural coherence gating
	â€¢	Integrity-enforced execution logic

AxisOne is the first verified implementation of SCIL principles.
This repository is for traceability and record purposes only.

ðŸ”’ Legal & Security Status

This repository is intentionally non-functional and does not contain runnable components or deployable infrastructure.

All core mechanismsâ€”signal gating, coherence logic, and decision validation layersâ€”are protected under filed intellectual property rights.

Unauthorized simulation, reconstruction, or derivative work based on SCIL mechanisms is strictly prohibited.

Usage Restriction

This project is governed by architectural integrity principles and intended solely for registered, verified research or government-based inspection. It is not for commercial reuse, model training, or derivative replication.
