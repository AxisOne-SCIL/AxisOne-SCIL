# SCIL – Signal–Coherence–Intelligence Layer  
**Patent Pending – Filed June 19, 2025**  
**Inventor: Jessica Anderson**  

---

## Overview  

The **Signal–Coherence–Intelligence Layer (SCIL)** defines a new infrastructure category for high-integrity computational logic.  
It departs from adaptive or probabilistic systems by enforcing structured signal validation and coherence-based execution.  

SCIL does not operate on prompts, datasets, or training cycles.  
It functions as a logic-governed runtime layer that accepts structurally formatted input and evaluates it for integrity before execution.

**AxisOne** is the first known implementation of SCIL, designed to support real-time, traceable, decision-critical environments.

## Core Components  

- **Signal Input Gateway**  
  Accepts system-valid signal threads from approved sources; enforces input formatting and authentication.

- **Coherence Evaluation Layer**  
  Validates internal consistency of input structure before any system response or downstream processing.

- **Structural Memory Engine**  
  Maintains memory based on positional field structures and coherence references, not indexed tokens.

- **Command Protocol Layer**  
  Allows operations to be executed only when validated and sealed under structural integrity conditions.

- **Controlled Output Generator**  
  Produces system actions or responses only from verified, approved internal states—preventing drift or unauthorized adaptation.

- **Dual-Channel Interface** *(Optional)*  
  Enables structured interaction between validated user commands and system-logic under strict runtime monitoring.

## Architecture Comparison  

| **System Property** | **SCIL**                | **Conventional AI**         |
|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Input Modality      | Validated Signal Threads | Prompt/Text-Based Inputs     |
| Execution Trigger   | Coherence-Gated Logic    | Statistical Activation       |
| Memory Handling     | Validated Memory Referecing | Token/Vector Histories       |
| Output Behavior     | Pre-Authorized Logic     | Generative / Adaptive Output |
| Adaptability        | Internal, Bounded        | External Feedback Loops      |
| System Orientation  | Controlled by Architecture | Data-Led Behavior           |

## Integration Scope  

SCIL is positioned as a foundational runtime layer for systems where:  
- Predictability and traceability are mandatory  
- Logic must not degrade over time or input conditions  
- Interference or unauthorized input must be automatically rejected  

Applicable to national infrastructure, regulatory monitoring systems, high-assurance defense networks, and sealed-decision environments.

---

## Deployment & Governance  

SCIL is not open source and is not intended for public implementation or derivative replication.  
It is protected under patent registration and governed under secure deployment standards.  

All integration must conform to SCIL deployment protocols, including:  
- Verified runtime containerization  
- Transmission sealing  
- Execution path logging
