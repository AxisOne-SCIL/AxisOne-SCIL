SCIL – Signal–Coherence–Intelligence Layer  
Patent Pending – Filed June 19, 2025  
Inventor: Jessica Anderson

Overview  
The Signal–Coherence–Intelligence Layer (SCIL) defines a new infrastructure class for deterministic, high-integrity logic execution.  
Unlike adaptive or probabilistic systems, SCIL governs computation through structured signal validation and coherence-based runtime controls.

SCIL does not rely on prompts, datasets, or statistical inference.  
It operates as a governed execution layer that accepts only structurally formatted input, evaluating each for logic consistency and security prior to action.

AxisOne is the first known internal implementation of SCIL, developed for traceable, decision-critical environments.

Core Components  
• Signal Input Gateway  
  Receives validated signal threads from approved sources. Ensures authentication and input formatting compliance.

• Coherence Evaluation Layer  
  Checks internal consistency before any processing or execution is permitted.

• Structural Memory Engine  
  Stores information based on coherence-linked structures, not token history or weight encoding.

• Command Protocol Layer  
  Authorizes execution only when structural verification is complete and command seals are valid.

• Controlled Output Generator  
  Produces output solely from verified internal states. No adaptive reshaping or drift occurs.

• Dual-Channel Interface (Optional)  
  Allows structured coordination between system-logic and authorized operator input, under monitored runtime conditions.

Integration Scope  
SCIL is designed for systems where:  
• Predictability and traceability are non-negotiable  
• Logic degradation must be structurally prevented  
• Unauthorized or malformed input must be automatically blocked  

Use cases include:  
• National infrastructure  
• Critical oversight systems  
• High-assurance defense environments  
• Signal-verified governance layers  

Deployment & Governance  
SCIL is a protected runtime system. It is not open source, and not available for unauthorized duplication or derivative work.

All implementations must comply with secure deployment protocols, including:  
• Verified runtime isolation  
• Sealed transmission handling  
• Full-path execution traceability
