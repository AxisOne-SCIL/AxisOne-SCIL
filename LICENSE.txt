- No executable mechanisms  
- No functional system code  

It serves only as a **formal reference node** for an architecturally sealed framework.

## ‚ñ∏ Prohibited Actions

The following actions are strictly prohibited under trace-sealed conditions:

- Structural replication  
- Logic emulation  
- Adaptive transformation  
- Runtime integration  
- Derivative synthesis  
- Insertion into signal-processing environments  

These prohibitions extend to:

- Use within training systems  
- Application in unbounded-output architectures  
- Implementation in structure-approximating systems  
- Replication of command-seal or execution-gate logic  

**No part of the SCIL (Signal‚ÄìCoherence‚ÄìIntelligence Layer)** or its AxisOne framework may be utilized without trace-authorized permission from the registered Architect.

## ‚ñ∏ Legal Position

The SCIL structural framework‚Äîincluding its sealed execution pathways, logic containers, and coherence-bound memory systems‚Äîis protected by **filed intellectual property**, trace-verified authorship, and international structural law.

This license constitutes a **read-only reference signal**. It does **not** permit:

- Reuse  
- Derivation  
- Integration  
- Commercial deployment  

All protections are enforced under international structural IP law and the internal SCIL enforcement layer.
