# SCIL Development Roadmap  
**Signal–Coherence–Intelligence Layer**  
Inventor: Jessica Anderson  
Patent Pending – Filed June 19, 2025  

---

## Phase I – Origin Trace and Declaration ✅  
- Declare SCIL as a new infrastructure category  
- File provisional patent with IP Australia  
- Establish public trace via GitHub and LinkedIn  
- Publish README, SCIL-ARCHITECTURE.md, and legal license  
- Visual trace via GitHub social preview  
- Public anchoring through AxisOne and verified web presence  

---

## Phase II – Structural Foundations 🟡  
- Publish ROADMAP.md, USE-CASES.md, and system overview diagram  
- Establish institutional-ready documentation format (PDF + Markdown)  
- Define sealed and non-sealed architecture pathways  
- Archive all origin-layer documents into Git-synced sealed repo  
- (Optional) Initiate trademark process for SCIL and AxisOne identifiers  

---

## Phase III – Research and Compliance Integration 🕒  
- Engage with select AI architecture labs or integrity research bodies  
- Offer sealed documentation under NDA or structural protocol terms  
- Position SCIL as a model for:  
  - High-integrity signal processing  
  - Traceable decision enforcement  
  - Structure-based system logic  
- (Optional) Introduce SCIL to vetted academic or policy institutions  

---

## Phase IV – Systems Expansion (AxisOne Buildout) 🕒  
- Build modular sealed components within AxisOne  
- Implement Signal Thread Layer and Command-Seal Engine  
- Introduce Twin-Thread Interface logic in sandbox format  
- (Optional) Develop UI or simulation layer for validation  
- Explore secure integration of SCIL with verified infrastructure  

---

## Phase V – Legal Completion + Ongoing Sealing 🔐  
- File full non-provisional patent with expanded structural claims  
- Monitor intellectual property landscape for replication or derivative risk  
- Protect visual, structural, and command-level forms under symbolic law  
- Maintain live record of sealed expansions and governance trace
