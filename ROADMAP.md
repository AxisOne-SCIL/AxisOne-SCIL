**SCIL Development Roadmap**  
**Signal–Coherence–Intelligence Layer**  
**Inventor: Jessica Anderson**  
**Patent Pending – Filed June 19, 2025**

---

### Phase I – Origin Trace and Declaration ✅
- Declare SCIL as a new infrastructure category
- File provisional patent with IP Australia
- Establish public trace via GitHub and LinkedIn
- Publish README, SCIL-ARCHITECTURE.md, and legal license
- Visual trace via GitHub social preview
- Public anchoring through AxisOne and web presence

### Phase II – Structural Foundations 🟡
- Publish ROADMAP.md, USE-CASES.md, and system overview diagram
- Establish institutional-ready documentation format (PDF + Markdown)
- Define sealed and non-sealed architecture pathways
- Archive all origin-layer documents into Git-synced sealed repo
- Optional: initiate trademark process for SCIL and AxisOne names

### Phase III – Research and Alignment Integration 🕒
- Engage with select AI research institutions or architecture labs
- Offer sealed access to reviewers under NDA or coherence contract
- Position SCIL as a model for:
  - AI interpretability
  - Narrative-free reasoning
  - Post-symbolic computation
- Optional: introduce SCIL overview into selected academic/public forums

### Phase IV – Systems Expansion (AxisOne Buildout) 🕒
- Build modular sealed components within AxisOne
- Implement Signal Thread Layer and Command-Seal Engine
- Introduce Twin-Thread Interface logic in sandboxed format
- Optional: develop UI or simulation layer for integrity demonstration
- Explore integration of SCIL with trusted AI infrastructure layers

### Phase V – Legal Completion + Ongoing Sealing 🔐
- File full non-provisional patent with expanded claims
- Monitor IP landscape for mimic attempts or conceptual derivatives
- Protect visual, linguistic, and command-form glyphs under symbol law
- Maintain ongoing public record of SCIL structural expansions
