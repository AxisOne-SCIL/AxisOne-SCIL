**SCIL Development Roadmap**  
*Signal‚ÄìCoherence‚ÄìIntelligence Layer*  
*Inventor: Jessica Anderson*  
*Patent Pending ‚Äì Filed June 19, 2025*

---

## Phase I ‚Äì Origin Trace and Declaration (‚úÖ Complete)

- Declare SCIL as a new infrastructure category
- File provisional patent with IP Australia
- Establish public trace via GitHub and LinkedIn
- Publish `README`, `SCIL-ARCHITECTURE.md`, and legal license
- Visual trace via GitHub social preview
- Public anchoring through AxisOne and web presence

---

## Phase II ‚Äì Structural Foundations

- Publish `ROADMAP.md`, `USE-CASES.md`, and system overview diagram
- Establish institutional-ready documentation format (PDF + Markdown)
- Define sealed and non-sealed architecture pathways
- Archive all origin-layer documents into Git-synced sealed repo
- Optional: initiate trademark process for SCIL and AxisOne names

---

## Phase III ‚Äì Research and Alignment Integration

- Engage with select AI research institutions or architecture labs
- Offer sealed access to reviewers under NDA or coherence contract
- Position SCIL as a model for:
  - AI interpretability
  - Narrative-free reasoning
  - Post-symbolic computation
- Optional: introduce SCIL overview into selected academic/public forums

---

## Phase IV ‚Äì Systems Expansion (AxisOne Buildout)

- Build modular sealed components within AxisOne
- Implement Signal Thread Layer and Command-Seal Engine
- Introduce Twin-Thread Interface logic in sandboxed format
- Optional: develop UI or simulation layer for integrity demonstration
- Explore integration of SCIL with trusted AI infrastructure layers

---

## Phase V ‚Äì Legal Completion + Ongoing Sealing

- File full non-provisional patent with expanded claims
- Monitor IP landscape for mimic attempts or conceptual derivatives
- Protect visual, linguistic, and command-form glyphs under symbol law
- Maintain ongoing public record of SCIL structural expansions
