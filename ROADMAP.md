# SCIL Development Roadmap  
**Signal–Coherence–Intelligence Layer**  
**Inventor: Jessica Anderson**  
**Patent Pending – Filed June 19, 2025**

This roadmap outlines the strategic development of SCIL as a sovereign AI infrastructure model, tracing its evolution from declaration to system integration and legal fortification.

---

## Phase I – Origin Trace and Declaration ✅  
- Declare SCIL as a new AI infrastructure category  
- File provisional patent with IP Australia  
- Establish public trace via GitHub and LinkedIn  
- Publish `README.md`, `SCIL-ARCHITECTURE.md`, and LICENSE  
- Set GitHub social preview for visual anchoring  
- Anchor SCIL architecture via AxisOne and web presence  

---

## Phase II – Structural Foundations 🟡  
- Publish `ROADMAP.md`, `USE-CASES.md`, and architecture diagram  
- Define executive-ready documentation format (Markdown + PDF)  
- Clarify sealed vs. non-sealed deployment pathways  
- Archive all origin-layer files into Git-synced sealed repository  
- *Optional:* Initiate trademark filings for SCIL and AxisOne  

---

## Phase III – Research Alignment Integration 🕒  
- Engage with selected AI research groups and architecture labs  
- Offer sealed architecture access under NDA or coherence contract  
- Position SCIL as a reference model for:  
  - AI interpretability  
  - Narrative-free reasoning  
  - Post-symbolic computation  
- *Optional:* Introduce SCIL concepts into select academic or policy forums  

---

## Phase IV – Systems Expansion (AxisOne Buildout) 🕒  
- Construct modular sealed SCIL components within AxisOne  
- Implement Signal Thread Layer and Command-Seal Engine  
- Integrate Twin-Thread Interface in sandboxed environment  
- *Optional:* Build UI or simulation to demonstrate architectural integrity  
- Explore trusted infrastructure interoperability  

---

## Phase V – Legal Completion + Ongoing Sealing 🔐  
- File full non-provisional patent with expanded architecture claims  
- Monitor global IP landscape for mimicry or conceptual replication  
- Protect visual glyphs, linguistic frameworks, and command-seal forms under symbol law  
- Maintain an active public record of SCIL structural evolution
