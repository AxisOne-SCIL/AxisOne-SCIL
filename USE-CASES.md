# SCIL Use Cases  
**Signal–Coherence–Intelligence Layer**  
**Inventor:** Jessica Anderson  
**Patent Pending – Filed June 19, 2025**  

---

## Executive Summary

SCIL defines a high-integrity execution architecture for systems requiring traceable, non-adaptive logic.  
It replaces probabilistic computation with signal-verified structural enforcement.  

This enables controlled operation in environments where failure, distortion, or uncontrolled adaptation is unacceptable.

## Primary Use Case Classes

### 1. Coherence-Governed Decision Systems
- Execution systems that operate strictly from structurally valid signal input.
- Applicable in critical response systems, national oversight logic, and sealed decision nodes.

### 2. Secure Signal Interfaces
- Interfaces where commands are accepted only if structurally authenticated.
- Used in restricted-access control systems, high-security defense logic, and sealed command protocols.

### 3. Interference-Free Logic Environments
- Designed for system environments where adaptive drift or external feedback loops cannot be tolerated.
- Applied in nuclear coordination systems, deep-space controls, and runtime isolation modules.

### 4. Promptless System-to-System Execution
- Enables runtime response without reliance on externally constructed prompts or generative instruction formats.
- Used in autonomous mission execution, aerospace logic transfer, and runtime-critical interface layers.

### 5. Structured Operator–System Coordination
- Systems allowing bounded interaction between authorized signal operators and SCIL-executed logic under surveillance.
- Applied in verified research environments, sealed simulation modules, and direct signal-governed coordination layers.
