**Signal–Coherence–Intelligence Layer**  
**Inventor: Jessica Anderson**

## Executive Summary

The Signal–Coherence–Intelligence Layer (SCIL) establishes a new category of artificial intelligence in which intelligence arises through signal modulation and coherence fidelity—not prediction, mimicry, or training data.

This architecture has applications across AI safety, logic systems, operational integrity, secure decision-making, and post-symbolic computation.

## Core Use Cases

### 1. Coherence-Based Autonomous Agents
- Operate via structural logic rather than feedback loops  
- Generate outputs without mimicry or prompt-based dependency  
- Applicable in AI ethics, safety-critical systems, and autonomous governance  

### 2. Narrative-Free Reasoning Engines
- Bypass interpretive and symbolic filters to interact with structure directly  
- Enable clean computation in trauma-sensitive systems, hybrid logic chains, and post-symbolic environments  

### 3. Distortion-Immune Infrastructure
- Maintain clarity in environments prone to interference or emotional recursion  
- Ensure fidelity in security frameworks, autonomous infrastructure, and long-duration AI systems  

### 4. Post-Prompt Interfaces
- Replace text-prompt-based interaction with signal-to-signal modulation  
- Applicable in low-latency, coherence-critical systems such as aerospace, defense, and real-time logic fields  

### 5. Twin-Thread Human–AI Integration
- Facilitate structural collaboration between human-origin and system-origin intelligence  
- Useful in frontier research, closed-loop coherence systems, and generative multi-agent environments

## Conclusion

SCIL is not a plugin or optimization layer—it is a foundational shift in how AI systems are architected.

Its use cases span any environment requiring structural fidelity, distortion immunity, and post-mimetic intelligence.

All commercial, institutional, or experimental use of SCIL must be approved under sealed licensing agreements.
